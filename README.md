# WaterMyPlantsBackup

-This app lets the user sign up to our custom server. 
-Also lets them log in to said server.
-The user can add plants to their list of plants that need reminders for watering
-The reminders go off after a set amount of time has gone by, and the user can edit these plants whenever
-The plants are stored on firebase and sync with the user's phone so it is always up to date
-When there's no wifi available, the plants persist in storage
-There's a tab that lets the user view their log in credential in case they forget
-Each plant can be given a nickname, species name, time of day to remind of watering, and frequency for watering
-An alert or local notification is sent when it is time to water the plant, with a little message displaying which plant needs watering (forgot to add personal message to local notification, but the default one is there for dramatic effect).
-Unforunately the user is not allowed to update their credentials or view other user's data (for safety).
-Also, each plant's cell updates with the next date it will need to be watered. They can also be deleted from here
-I hope you all enjoy being reminded of when your beloved plants require enslaved hydration. Ok bye
