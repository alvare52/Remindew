# WaterMyPlantsBackup


  This app lets users set reminders for when to water their plants. The reminders go off after a set amount of time has gone by, and the user can edit these plants whenever. Each plant can be given a nickname, species name, time of day to remind of watering, and frequency for watering. An alert or local notification is sent when its time to water the plant, with a message displaying which plant needs watering. Also, each plant's cell updates with the next date it will need to be watered. They can also be deleted from here.
